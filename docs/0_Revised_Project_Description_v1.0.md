# Google Drive Auto Backup Utility
Version: 1.0
Date: 2025-08-14

## 1. Concise Project Description
Google Drive Auto Backup Utility is a Streamlit-based desktop-friendly web application that helps users rapidly discover, select, and back up large or important files from Google Drive (including Shared Drives) to local or offline storage. It addresses the pain of Drive storage limits, opaque large-file discovery, and manual, error-prone download steps by providing authenticated inventory filtering, size/date/mime-based selection, resumable downloads, logging, integrity manifest generation, and a foundation for incremental + scheduled backups.

## 2. Problem / Gap Statement
Users struggle to reclaim or safeguard storage because Google Drive's native UI makes it slow to identify largest files, lacks bulk integrity logging, and offers no simple workflow for offline archival. Manual downloads introduce risk of missed files, duplicates, partial transfers, and no audit trail. The absence of an approachable backup workflow leads to higher storage costs, clutter, and data loss risk.

## 3. High-Level Solution Summary
Provide a focused UI to: (1) authenticate securely; (2) enumerate large / recent / targeted files with intuitive filters; (3) select or bulk-select by rule; (4) perform resumable, parallel-safe downloads to user-chosen destinations; (5) generate logs + manifests for proof and future incremental runs. Architecture cleanly separates UI, Drive API adapter, download engine, and persistence/log layers.

## 4. Core Value Propositions
- Time savings via rapid large-file discovery
- Reduced storage overage costs
- Higher confidence with verifiable manifest + logging
- Extensible foundation for incremental + scheduled backups

## 5. Primary Users & Personas
- Individual consumer (personal Drive at quota)
- Freelancer / consultant archiving clients assets
- Small business admin performing periodic compliance backups

## 6. Success Metrics (MVP)
- >90% of targeted files downloaded without manual retry
- Ability to list >25k files < 2 minutes (network & API quota permitting)
- User can complete first backup workflow in <10 minutes
- Zero critical P1 defects in core backup path after first week of pilot

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions
- User supplies their own Google OAuth client
- Read-only scope used (no deletion) for trust & lower risk
- Network bandwidth + Google API quotas may throttle large jobs
- Local filesystem has sufficient space; app will pre-check free space (later enhancement if not in MVP)

## 8. Out of Scope (MVP)
- Automatic continuous sync
- Real-time change notifications
- Team-wide multi-user role management
- Encryption at rest (planned v2)

## 9. Risks & Mitigations (Selected)
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API quota limits | Slow scans | Progressive loading + pageSize tuning |
| Large file interruption | Partial data | Resumable downloads + retry/backoff |
| User mis-selects files | Wasted bandwidth | Clear size indicators + filters |
| Credential leakage | Account exposure | Local-only storage of tokens & guidance |

## 10. Release Versioning
MVP tagged v1.0; semantic versioning adopted. Enhancements increment minor; fixes patch.

## 11. Deliverables (v1.0)
- Streamlit UI + Drive adapter + logging
- Docs: PRD, High-Level Design, Low-Level Design, README, Setup Guide
- Test scripts (basic unit + smoke)

## 12. Future Roadmap (abridged)
- v1.1: Incremental diffing (revisionId cache)
- v1.2: Scheduling helper + email summary
- v2.0: Encryption & integrity verification tool, duplicate detection
